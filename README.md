# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval outcomes using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process and improving efficiency.

## Introduction

Banks and financial institutions often face challenges in efficiently processing loan applications. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can automate the loan approval decision-making process.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the file. It includes information about some crucial data that should be considered for Loan Approval.

## Features

- **Feature 1:** Gender
- **Feature 2:** Married
- **Feature 3:** Dependents
- **Feature 4:** Education
- **Feature 5:** Self_Employed
- **Feature 6:** ApplicantIncome
- **Feature 7:** CoapplicantIncome
- **Feature 8:** LoanAmount
- **Feature 9:** Loan_Amount_Term
- **Feature 10:** Credit_History
- **Feature 11:** Property_Area
- **Feature 12:** Loan_Status

## Methods

We employed the following machine learning algorithms for predicting loan approval:

- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Logistic Regression
- GaussianNB
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results

The accuracy scores achieved by each model on the test dataset are as follows:

- Random Forest Classifier: 80.42%
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 63.75%
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 69.17%
- Logistic Regression: 81.67%
- GaussianNB: 81.67%
- Decision Tree Classifier: 68.33%
